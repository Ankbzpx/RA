# RA
A robotic Arm simulator in Unity. It is capable of interacting and picking the pile of blocks in the scene.

The physic detection was inspired by the Kinematic Character Controller (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/kinematic-character-controller-99131). 

The inverse kinematics was solved byFABRIK (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070311000178).
